# SearchAndConcat
This is a script that includes a simple but effective user interface to automate a task I had at a previous job.

[Here is a video of the script working in action.](https://youtu.be/mCuUD6Bu2VE)

Click the file 'SearchAndUpload' to see the code itself. This was inspired by a problem I faced while working on a group project during a hack-a-thon.

I made this script to remove the unnecessary process of having to do this manually and now it can be done with a few mouse clicks. 
Please note that I am not a programmer or developer and had no help other than Google and StockOverflow while making this script.

This Python script searches the specified folder path for specific CSV files and joins all the information into a single master CSV file.

Each section of code is preceded by a comment of what the following section of code does or how it relates to the program overall.

Thank you for taking a look.
